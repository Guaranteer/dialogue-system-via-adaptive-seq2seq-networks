A dialog system via adaptive seq2seq network
==========

##main algorithm

I'm lazy to describe it now。
____________

##baseline

* seq2seq
* seq2seq with attention
* HRED
* VHRED (not standard)
______________


##directory

* configs：configure files
* models: model files
* trains: train files
* utils: util files
* dataloaders: data loader files (change according to different dataset)

___________

##dataset 

Please obtain dataset yourself and code a dataloader for it.

I use cornell movie corpus and reconstruct it.

____________

##other

The code is about my research and I only save it on github. So it is very rough and maybe difficult to understand. 

xixi.
